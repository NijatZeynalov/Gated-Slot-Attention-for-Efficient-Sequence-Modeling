# Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Sequence Modeling

## Overview

This project aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Transformer-based models by incorporating **Gated Slot Attention (GSA)**. Transformer models are incredibly powerful for various sequence modeling tasks, such as **text classification**, **language translation**, and **time-series prediction**, but they can be resource-intensive and require significant computational power. **Gated Slot Attention** is designed to make these models faster, more efficient, and better at focusing on important information in the input.


## Project Structure

- `src/models/`:
  - **`gsa.py`**: Implements the Gated Slot Attention layer, which enhances the attention mechanism by focusing on the relevant parts of the input.
  - **`transformer.py`**: Contains the Transformer model incorporating GSA, providing a more focused and efficient version of the typical Transformer.
- `src/training/`:
  - **`trainer.py`**: Manages the training loop, including model optimization, mixed-precision training, and evaluation.
  - **`optimizer.py`**: Contains utility functions for creating optimizers and learning rate schedulers, making training customizable.
- `src/data/`:
  - **`dataloader.py`**: Handles data loading, tokenization, and batching to efficiently manage inputs to the model.
- `src/utils/`:
  - **`metrics.py`**: Computes key evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
  - **`logger.py`**: Provides consistent logging throughout the training process.

## How It Works

The core of this project is the **Gated Slot Attention** mechanism that sits on top of the Transformer architecture. Traditional Transformers use **attention mechanisms** that look at all parts of the input equally, which can be inefficient. **GSA** addresses this by creating "slots" that learn to focus on only the most important parts of the input, and it uses a "gate" to control how much information is passed through these slots.

This results in a model that is:
- **Faster**: Less computational power is required as the model can focus its attention selectively.
- **More efficient**: Uses less memory, making it suitable for environments with limited resources.
- **Better at filtering noise**: By attending only to the relevant parts, GSA improves the model's ability to ignore unimportant details.


## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Model

1. **Configuration**: Update the configuration files (`config.yaml` or `config.json`) to match your needs.
2. **Training**: Run the training script to train the model on your data:

   ```sh
   bash scripts/train.sh
   ```
3. **Evaluation**: Use the evaluation script to assess model performance:

   ```sh
   bash scripts/evaluate.sh
   ```

## Benefits of Using Gated Slot Attention

- **Reduced Resource Requirements**: The GSA-enhanced Transformer needs fewer GPU resources, which reduces the cost of training and inference.
- **Selective Attention**: By focusing only on the relevant parts of the sequence, GSA ensures that the model performs well even on noisy data.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for both short and long sequences, as GSA mitigates the inefficiency of processing irrelevant parts of long inputs.

## Example Input/Output

- **Input**: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
- **Output**: Predicted classification (`Positive` sentiment) or text continuation ("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog and runs into the forest.") depending on the task.
